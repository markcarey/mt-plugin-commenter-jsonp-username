# Commenter JSONP Username

A plugin for Movable Type thats adds the commenter username to the jsonp response from the session_js method of the comments script. Note that some sites prefer not to save the username on the client and may not want to publish the username publicly - such policies may affect whether -- and how -- this plugin is used.

## Requirements:

- Commenter Session State plugin (https://github.com/markcarey/mt-plugin-commenter-session-state)
